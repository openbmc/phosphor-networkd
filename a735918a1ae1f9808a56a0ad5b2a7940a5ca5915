      "message": "Could you please explain how exactly this is expected to work.\n\nImagine that a BMC is configured to send SNMP traps or syslog events to a remote host outside of immediately connected networks. With more than 1 default gateway, how will one be selected to send the packets through?\n\nAlso, how exactly the user is going to control that from WebUI ? \n\nUnless that is explained and a linked commit to WebUI is created, I\u0027m all against this change because I see it as a potential source of serious network configuration troubles.",
