These two functions are actually coming from network_manager_main.cpp and are not included in the header file and are also not included as a part of manager class as well. And by definition Mock manager is a mock class for manager so thats, not the ideal place to put these functions.\n\nThere are certain tests like rtnetlink that need these functions to be inside the phosphor::network namespace and not inside a mockmanager object.",
