      "message": "I had not considered that. I continued using the mode already established by the prior author. D-Bus is already providing an array of bytes in the correct form. Is there an advantage to be gained by pointing those bytes at addrFromBuf as a string_view, then having it copy those bytes into a in_addr{6}, recasting them to InAddrAny, and then passing them to toString to be handed to inet_ntop? I\u0027d rather just provide the bytes to inet_ntop directly.",
