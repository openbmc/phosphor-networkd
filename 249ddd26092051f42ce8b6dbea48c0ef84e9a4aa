      "message": "Hi Patrick/Amithash,\n\nI am working on porting ncsi-util commands from YV3 to ncsi-netlink tool. As part of that I have made changes to port show-statistics command.\nWanted to get your feedback on the approach. \n\nThis is still work in progress and I have marked by review as private.\n\nI have included the test results(which are hex as of now). I am working to display textual representation.\n\nPlease review and let me know if this approach looks good.\n\nThanks \n\nSharan",
