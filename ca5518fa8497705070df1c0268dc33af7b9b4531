      "message": "I\u0027m sorry, but this needs a detailed test plan and ideally automation test cases.\n\nthere are at least two use cases for multiple interfaces that need to work.\n\nwe used to have IP routing for each interface including independent gateway.    this was ripped out and the current code was created and patched.   I agree it\u0027s probably broken in several use cases.   but we need to make progress forward not break existing users.\n\n\nthe two obvious cases are two independent network connections with disjoint subnets and routers,  and two interfaces plugged in into the wo network switch ports in the same subnet.\n\nby default Linux will recognize any IP address assigned to any interface and reply on the current route.   when two interfaces have the same routing priority it\u0027s essentially a race which interface and route will be used.   this results in foreign peers (including routers) to essentially learn a random Mac for any assigned address.    \n\nif the interfaces are then reconfigured, the router will continue to use the prior or failed Mac address to the remaining IP and communication is lost.",
