      "message": "I don\u0027t approve of adding this commit to the phosphor-network mainline.\n\nThis creates an undesirable side-effect for environments that have a DHCPv6 server, but don\u0027t want their BMC to have a DHCPv6 address. When the BMC is told to turn RA off the expectation is there will only be static IPv6 addresses and static routes present in the system.\n\nThis is especially important for IPMI, as the only knob to modify is Set Lan Config Routing Advertisement Configuration. When this register has disabled \"dynamic router advertisement\" (bit 2 clear) the expectation is there will be no addresses reported in Get LAN Config IPv6 Dynamic Address.\n\nThis change causes the IPv6 Dynamic Address to report a value. This commit assumes this is desirable for all OBMC users. I already have several defects filed against phosphor-network related to IPMI DHCPv6/v4 address handling. Allowing this commit to propagate only ensures I have another added to the list.\n\nIt is mandatory for IPMI to work, correctly, for all use cases. The only in-band method for controlling IPv4/IPv6 addressing from BIOS is via IPMI. It is also highly desirable that solutions operate without requiring retooling BIOS IPMI behavior. It appears that most commits only test Redfish functionality, without regard to IPMI functionality. IMO a commit has to function in both Redfish, and IPMI before it is submitted for review.\n\nThis was the point of adding the DHCP enumerations in phos-dbus-intf over a year ago. It allowed IPMI to perform correct state transforms while only having control of the single Routing Advertisement Configuration register.",

      "message": "I still don\u0027t quite understand what \"problem\" this is trying to solve.\nIMO this is optimizing for a use case that won\u0027t be present in the BMCs environment.\nIs it really likely that a room full of servers with BMCs on board are going to be in a RA-less network? IMO this is extremely unlikely.\n\nTLDR; don\u0027t support WithoutRA in OpenBMC. Simplify the RA/DHCPv6 model.\n\nI agree that D-Bus permits control of a DHCPv4 boolean, a DHCPv6 boolean, and the IPv6AcceptRA boolean. However, there is no direct mapping in either Redfish or IPMI for all three of these booleans.\n\nIPMI can only control DHCPv4, and IPv6AcceptRA.\nRedfish has control of the DHCPv4 boolean.\nRedfish OperatingMode only controls DHCPv6 state at the current moment. I don\u0027t see an obvious location for Redfish to control IPv6AcceptRA. IMO StatelessAddressAutoConfiguration is not it.\n\nIMO, the 98+% use case for OperatingMode enabled is IPv6AcceptRA enabled, DHCPv6 enabled. Right now there is no way for Redfish to fully DISABLE IPv6. If you use Redfish to \"Disable\" DHCPv6 via OperatingMode you still have the possibility of SLAAC addresses being assigned. This is a surprising outcome. The Redfish command was to \"Disable\" dynamic address assignment. If you use the proposed StatelessAddressAutoConfiguration commit to disable IPv6AcceptRA you have just eliminated Stateful DHCPv6 assignment. This is a surprising outcome. I toggled a Stateless control and I have my Stateful addresses impacted? IMO OperatingMode disabled should change the phosphor-network D-Bus entries to IPv6AcceptRA\u003ddisabled, DHCPv6 disabled. Now all dynamic addressing is disabled, which mirrors the DHCPv4 model.\n\nFollowing that paradigm IPMI can be updated to do the same when Set LAN Config IPv6 Router Address Configuration is toggled. Asserting bit 1 in this command enables both IPv6AcceptRA and DHCPv6. Clearing bit 1 disables IPv6AcceptRA and DHCPv6.\n\nIf we use this paradigm:\nNetworks with an RA/DHCPv6 server will configure the BMC with Stateful addresses if the DHCPv6 server is configured that way. It will assign Stateless addresses if the network segment has an RA only asserting the \u0027O\u0027 bit, and the DHCPv6 server is providing secondary IP addresses (DNS/NTP/etc..). If there isn\u0027t an RA on the network segment, then we should press the Redfish working group for a control allowing the DHCPv6 system to request what to do when an RA is not present.\n\nUsing this paradigm allows IPMI to work orthogonally without having to create some OpenBMC centric OEM command for controlling the DHCPv6 boolean independently of the IPv6AcceptRA boolean. If in the future there is a control added for controlling WithoutRA then IPMI will need some mechanism added for controlling it.",
