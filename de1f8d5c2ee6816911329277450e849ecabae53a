      "message": "What is the purpose of this change?\nI applied this code and tried a few things on my SUT.\nThe first was to confirm my RA/DHCPv6 servers supplied a DHCP address and route that allowed me to send/receive packets.\nI then used the IPv6 Router Address Configuration Control, \u0027ipmitool raw 0xc 1 1 0x40 1\u0027, to disable RA. The expectation is that the DHCPv6 address will also disappear.\nI was surprised to find that my BMC still had a DHCPv6 address.\nI was also surprised to find that traffic via that address failed to operate.\n\nThis change appears to introduce two unwanted artifacts.\nHow is your SUT/environment configured such that this change is desirable in your environment?",
