      "message": "I am not sure the consensus with the maintainers here is, but it would be a lot more easier to read if we used a CLI parser library like CLI11 (https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11). I know other openbmc repos use this. Reason I proposed this is because we have a lot of \"sub-command\" parsing in this source file which would be easily covered by a library.",
