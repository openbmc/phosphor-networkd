The prior code change that allowed IPv6AcceptRA leaked implementation details for systemd.network to both IPMI and Redfish.\n\nThe IPMI and Redfish code should request state changes, and allow phosphor-network to achieve those state changes. Performing the task with the enumerations above allows both IPMI and Redfish to request new state without knowledge of the underlying components.

This, IMO, validates that we have the incorrect API present on D-Bus.\n\nThe whole point of this change is to eliminate the leak of how systemd.network performs the work of getting DHCPv4 and v6 configured. Making the IPv6AcceptRA element visible on D-Bus was a mistake. It enables only part of the control necessary to correctly manage IPv6 address assignment. It needs to be ditched, IMO.\n\n\"in the RA message if A bit is set(M and O is not set) then you don\u0027t need DHCP, You only need the advertised  prefix from the router and do the SLAAC.\"\n\nWhat happens when those bits ARE set and you don\u0027t want DHCP? Having the ability to explicitly write DHCPv6Client true/false allows the BMC to choose to accept or to ignore those bits. I\u0027ve configured my radvd to enable both of those, and with IPv6AcceptRA\u003dtrue/DHCPv6Client\u003dtrue you get both DHCPv6 and SLAAC addresses. Using the \"v6stateless\" enum changes the combination to \"true/false\" and the BMC only performs a SLAAC assignment. This seems to me to be the correct operation.\n\nIf the directive from the maintainers is to make the flagged function continue to work, and to keep the technical debt associated, then an actionable recommendation has been provided.\n\nIs keeping that D-Bus entry active and performing some action the direction the maintainers wish?",

If that is the case, can you be explicit on what part of this change is the problem?\n\nJohnathan created this change because the network configuration is not currently working for our needs. Rather than make a little fix that would probably necessitate further changes in the future, he made this change more complete, filling in all the possibilities.\n\nThe options offered in the patch not only provide a way to put the BMC into any of the dynamic addressing modes (all combinations of DHCPv4, DHCPv6, SLAAC, and NONE), but also does so in a very straightforward interface that is independent of IPMI and Redfish.\n\nSomehow both you and Ratan have come to the conclusion that this does not support v6 stateless (SLAAC). I am not sure how that conclusion was reached, given that this is explicitly one of the options available. If you disagree with that, please let Johnathan know how it does not fulfill your interpretation of this requirement.\n\nIf you are still not convinced, I would invite you to test the code in your environment and provide specific feedback on what is not working so we can move this patch forward.",

      "message": "There is a commit that William has pending. One that I\u0027d like to see merged. It uses netlink to query the assignment source for each address on the NIC. IMO using netlink is the superior method for detecting how the IP address was actually assigned. Inferring assignment based on DHCP enablement is flawed.\n\nIPv6 can have multiple IP addresses on the NIC. One could be statically assigned, one SLAAC, and one Stateful. Using the current logic all of these instances would be flagged \"DHCP\" assigned, when there\u0027s at least one that is statically assigned.\n\nThe results from netlink only announce \"static\" and \"dynamic\". There\u0027s only a single bit. IMO this is enough. Stateful and Stateless/SLAAC required no human interaction on the client to acquire an IPv6 address. This is DHCP. If, on the other hand, you used a UI, and explicitly typed in an IPv6 address, and all the other IPv6 network configuration data, you\u0027ve used a static assignment.\n\nAs to the D-Bus interfaces entry. Sometimes entries get made that ultimately turn out to be an \"appendix\". Nobody can figure out what the human appendix is good for, but it\u0027s there anyway.\n\nAdditionally, the two reporting/control protocols OBMC uses, IPMI and Redfish, up to this point have not had an interface providing visibility/control over IPv6 SLAAC.\n\nSo far as I can determine, there\u0027s no way other than parsing IPv6 addresses for a specific pattern to determine if an address is SLAAC. The netlink API won\u0027t tell you. Inferring from the systemd.network configuration won\u0027t tell you, and parsing IPv6 addresses is a marginal idea to figure it out. Without a reliable method of identifying the IP address assignment mode I don\u0027t expect anyone is going to go out of their way to announce an IPv6 address as SLAAC assigned when, in the majority of use cases, reporting DHCP is enough.",
