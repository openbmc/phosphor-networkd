      "message": "We assign link local addresses this way. There is no reason they shouldn\u0027t be assignable since they aren\u0027t necessarily tied to anything. They are still usable addresses on a local network. Auto generation is just one way they are assigned.\n\nIf some BMCs decide they want this (I\u0027m not really sure why), we can figure out how to make runtime policies for it.",
