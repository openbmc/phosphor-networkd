      "message": "The sit0 interface does not assert the IFF_RUNNING flag. It only seems to assert the IFF_NOARP flag.\nAdmittedly, this test casts a wider net than I\u0027d like. In spite of that I don\u0027t see it being much different than the net cast on line 276. The test here is directly lifted from line 276.\nIf this test is too broad, then perhaps a string compare of the first three letters in the ifa_name could be done to reduce the possibility of false positives.\nIf a string compare is the solution here, does the code on line 276 need to be reconsidered?",
